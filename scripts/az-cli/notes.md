## How To

To deploy a Private GPT instance on Azure, here are the general steps:

Create an Azure account: If you haven't already, sign up for an Azure subscription.
Choose a virtual machine size: Select a suitable VM size that meets your requirements (e.g., CPU, memory, storage). For example, consider using a DSv4 or Dsv5 series instance with at least 16 GB of RAM and 8 vCPUs.
Install the necessary software:

- Install Docker on the Azure virtual machine.
- Pull the Private GPT image from Docker Hub (or use your own custom-built image).
- Run a container using the pulled image, specifying any required environment variables or configurations for your instance.
  Configure and secure your instance: Set up authentication mechanisms to restrict access to your Private GPT instance. This might involve creating an Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant, configuring role-based access control (RBAC), and setting up a network security group (NSG).
  Monitor and manage resources:
- Use the Azure Monitor service to track performance metrics for your VM.
- Set up automated backups or snapshots of your instance using Azure Backup.
  Please note that these steps are high-level guidelines, and you may need additional configuration depending on specific requirements like scaling, load balancing, or integrating with other services. For more detailed instructions, I recommend referring to official documentation from Microsoft (Azure) and the Private GPT project maintainers for up-to-date guidance.
